# **TWI Status Codes ‚Äî ATmega328**

This document provides a complete table of **TWI status codes** from the **TWSR** register, used to monitor and control I¬≤C communication in both **master** and **slave** modes. These codes are essential for implementing software-controlled state machines and debugging TWI operations.

## **Accessing the Status Code**

The status code is stored in the upper 5 bits of the **TWSR** register:

| Bit | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 7   | TWS7 (TWI Status) |
| 6   | TWS6 (TWI Status) |
| 5   | TWS5 (TWI Status) |
| 4   | TWS4 (TWI Status) |
| 3   | TWS3 (TWI Status) |
| 2   | Reserved |
| 1   | TWPS1 (TWI Prescaler Bit 1) |
| 0   | TWPS0 (TWI Prescaler Bit 0) |

```c
uint8_t statusCode = TWSR & 0xF8;
```

> [!NOTE]
> The lower 3 bits (TWPS1:0) are used for the prescaler and must be masked out.

## **Using Status Codes in Software**

Status codes are typically used in a **state machine** to guide the flow of I¬≤C communication. Example:

```c
switch (TWSR & 0xF8) 
{
  case 0x08:
    // START transmitted
    TWDR = (slaveAddress << 1) | 0; // Write mode
    TWCR = (1<<TWINT) | (1<<TWEN);
    break;

  case 0x18:
    // SLA+W transmitted, ACK received
    TWDR = dataByte;
    TWCR = (1<<TWINT) | (1<<TWEN);
    break;

  case 0x28:
    // Data transmitted, ACK received
    TWCR = (1<<TWINT) | (1<<TWSTO) | (1<<TWEN); // Send STOP
    break;

  default:
    // Handle error or unexpected state
    break;
}
```

## **Best Practices**

- Always mask TWSR with `0xF8` to isolate the status code.
- Use status codes to validate each step of communication.
- Implement fallback or retry logic for unexpected codes.
- Monitor for arbitration loss and bus errors to maintain robustness.

> [!TIP]
> TWI status codes are the backbone of reliable I¬≤C communication. Treat them as checkpoints in your protocol flow.
